Parents Advisor is a transformative tool in the realm of modern parenting. It combines scientific insight, education, and sheer fun, offering unparalleled support for today's parents. With Parents Advisor, parenting becomes a breeze, all powered by the magic of AI.


## A description of my experience using AI to build the solution
With 17 years in SharePoint and expertise in Power Platform, I've spent the last year harnessing AI services like OpenAI's APIs, Azure OpenAI, and Azure Cognitive Services. To create "Parents Advisor" solution, my work started in Feburary when I first had the idea of using AI to assist parenting.

# Why I chose to create the solution
As a parent myself, I've witnessed the challenges faced by modern parents who juggle multiple roles. Parents Advisor captures the potential of AI to tackle these real-world issues, providing scientific parenting advice and engaging educational content for children.

# How AI helped me build this solution
AI played a revolutionary role in building apps including Parents Advisor. None of the intelligent functions would be possible without the help of AI. It saved tremendous time and efforts. It has transformed the platform into a dynamic tool for parents.
